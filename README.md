- may want to save this to github if anything works

## read csv
- figure out how to delete the rows that are not in NYC
- can i delete a full row based off of commodity column being gas
- can i delete columns i do not need next?
- save esco name and rate first as a struct

## graph
- will show total of each esco * kwh's used + delivery charge
- show in bar chart




## q's
- should i read in coned csv for it's data or just sit it

### l8tr goals
- multiple line graph that shows what break down of multiple esco's over 12 months
    - have to be fixed cause variable will change
    - based on past 12 months of usage with coned + fixed rate
    - also have coned bills from last 12 months
