        <h3>Info on above Graph</h3>
        <p>Graph of what my dec 2021 electric bill would be based on every ESCO provided by NY Power to Choose</p>
        <p>Total* is calculated with my dec 2021 kw usage * rate from every ESCO + conEd delivery charge**</p>
        <p>ConEd Total, green bar, is shockingly cheapest for Dec 2021. (Note this is the monthly rate given to NY Power To Choose
            from ConEd. Not my actual bill.</p>
        
        <p><i>*Total is above calcauation minus the fees and taxes</i></p>
        <p><i>**This charge will not change regardless of ESCO choosen as ConEd is only energy company that actually delivers</i></p>

        <p>My Dec 2021 kW usage: 422</p>
        <p>My Dec 2021 delivery charge: $74.65</p>
        <p>My actual Dec 2021 Bill (with fees): $108.86 at 6.4408 Â¢/kWh</p>
